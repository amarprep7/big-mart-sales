### 2. 🔧 Data Processing & Feature Engineering Pipeline

#### 💾 Data Storage Strategy
Raw datasets are maintained in `data/raw/` while processed, analysis-ready data is stored in `data/processed/` to ensure clear data lineage and reproducibility.

#### 🔄 Comprehensive Preprocessing Workflow

> **🛠️ Missing Value Treatment**  
> Implemented intelligent imputation strategies, including weight interpolation based on item patterns and outlet size completion using outlet type correlations

> **📊 Data Standardization**  
> Normalized categorical values (particularly `Item_Fat_Content`) to ensure consistency across the dataset

> **🔍 Feature Extraction**  
> Derived meaningful features such as item type categorization and outlet age calculation from establishment year

> **⚡ Advanced Feature Engineering**  
> Created composite features including price-per-weight ratios, store age-size interactions, and visibility-MRP cross-products to capture complex relationships

> **🏷️ Categorical Encoding**  
> Applied ordinal encoding techniques for categorical variables to preserve inherent ordering relationships

### 3. 🧪 Systematic Model Development & Optimization

#### 📈 Experimental Workflow

**🎯 Baseline Model Establishment**  
Initiated the modeling process with fundamental regression algorithms (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to establish performance benchmarks and validate the overall approach.

**🔬 Feature Engineering & Impact Assessment**  
Developed and rigorously tested new predictive features including `Price_per_Weight`, `Store_Age_Size`, and `Visibility_MRP` interactions, systematically evaluating their contribution to model performance.

**🎛️ Feature Selection Optimization**  
Employed XGBoost feature importance analysis to identify the most predictive variables. Conducted comprehensive testing across different feature set sizes (6, 10, and 20 top features) to determine the optimal feature combination that balances model complexity with predictive power.

**⚙️ Hyperparameter Optimization**  
Executed extensive RandomizedSearchCV on XGBoost across multiple hyperparameters including `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`, `gamma`, `reg_alpha`, and `reg_lambda`. Selection criteria focused on maximizing cross-validation R² scores while maintaining model generalizability.

**✅ Robust Model Validation**  
Implemented 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model stability and minimize overfitting risks, providing confidence in the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

**📊 Comparative Model Analysis**  
Conducted thorough performance comparison between XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, with XGBoost demonstrating superior performance in both R² metrics and generalization capabilities.

**📝 Comprehensive Experiment Documentation**  
Maintained detailed logs of all experimental configurations, parameter grids, and results to ensure complete reproducibility and facilitate future model iterations.
